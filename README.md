> This project objective is to make the bikers everyday routine easier by increasing the safety while improving the biker’s experience. The system responsible to make it possible will consist in a smartphone with GPS, accelerometer and an ”App” to send orders, a box contains a microcontroller with its Bluetooth shield, a backlight which has a back red light with blinkers on both sides, a light sensor and a front light.


The smartphone is the main part of the project because it is the connection between the microcontroller and the user, so is the responsible to send the user's orders. Furthermore, it is the smartphone’s responsibility to send and receive actions to and from the microcontroller.


The smartphone's app will use the GPS signal, Bluetooth and accelerometer of the phone. With this, the interface could show a map, provided by Google Maps, to guide the user on the roads. The user can indicate by using the blinkers in which direction he is going . In addition, there is going to be added an emergency button, so that in case of an accident, the user can make an emergency call and give the user an option for saving the location where bicycle has been parked. 


About the microcontroller, it will receive the order via Bluetooth to turn on the blinkers when the user is making a turn. That’s not the only function, the light sensor will also send data about the light in the surroundings and depending on it set the brightness
